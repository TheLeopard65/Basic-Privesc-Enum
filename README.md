Certainly! Here’s a Markdown template for a GitHub README file that includes basic privilege escalation commands commonly used in security assessments:

# Privilege Escalation Cheat Sheet

This document contains a list of useful commands for privilege escalation in Unix-like operating systems. These commands can help identify potential vectors for escalating privileges on a system.

- [Checking User and Group Information](#checking-user-and-group-information)

## Finding SUID Files

SUID (Set User ID) files are files that execute with the permissions of the file owner, which could potentially be used to escalate privileges.

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

## Finding SGID Files

SGID (Set Group ID) files are files that execute with the permissions of the file group, which can also be a vector for privilege escalation.

```bash
find / -perm -2000 2>/dev/null
```

## Checking Sudo Permissions

To see what commands the current user can execute with `sudo` privileges:

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Finding Writable Files and Directories

Identifying files and directories writable by the user can help in various privilege escalation scenarios.

```bash
find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
```

## Finding Executables in PATH

Finding executables in the PATH environment variable can help identify potentially exploitable scripts or binaries.

```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | xargs -I {} find {} -type f -executable 2>/dev/null
```

## Listing Scheduled Cron Jobs

Viewing cron jobs can reveal scheduled tasks that may be leveraged for privilege escalation.

```bash
crontab -l
ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs
ls /etc/cron.*
```

## Checking User and Group Information

Checking user and group details can provide insight into potential privilege escalation opportunities.

```bash
id
groups
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have proper authorization to run these commands on any system.
- Misuse of these commands can be illegal and unethical.
- Use these commands responsibly and in a controlled environment.
